# ChatBot Using NLP with NLTK
## Overview

This project implements a simple ChatBot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically leveraging the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. The ChatBot is designed to understand and respond to user queries by employing cosine similarity for measuring the similarity between input queries and predefined responses.

## Features

- **NLP Processing:** Utilizes NLTK for tokenization, stemming, and other NLP tasks to process user input and responses.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates cosine similarity to determine the most appropriate response based on the similarity between user input and predefined responses.
- **Configurable Responses:** Easily customize and expand the set of predefined responses to tailor the ChatBot to specific use cases.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the ChatBot.
